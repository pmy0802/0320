    <p>Maybe I'll forget, maybe I won't. I'm stuck in the moment, and so far from home. Cause loving nobody, is breaking my heart but you'll never know this, wherever you are. Well maybe I don't give up easily but I know this is hard to see.And I wish time would slow down. So I could keep your heart around. If I can't make you stay another day, I'll wait another day for you. For you.But I know time won't slow down. So I can't keep your heart in my hand but maybe if you stay a little while. You might feel like I do.</p>
